# 🎮 ASMR Programming Project

Welcome to my cozy 3D game development project made with **Unity**!  
Here I create game mechanics in a relaxing **ASMR programming** style — slow, focused, and without stress.

## 📚 About the project

This project is part of my journey into ASMR game development content.  
I aim to build a relaxed environment where coding feels like meditation, not pressure.

Feel free to explore, learn, and maybe even chill while checking the code!  
More features and mechanics will be added step-by-step.

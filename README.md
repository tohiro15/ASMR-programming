# 🎮 ASMR Programming Project

Welcome to my cozy repository with game development projects created with **Unity**!  
Here I create game mechanics in a relaxing style of **ASMR programming** - slow, focused and stress-free.

## 📚 About the project

These projects are part of my journey to making games.
I aim to create a relaxed atmosphere where coding feels like meditation rather than pressure.

Feel free to explore, learn, and maybe even relax while checking out the code!
New features and mechanics will be added gradually.
